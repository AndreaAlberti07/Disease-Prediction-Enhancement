# Workflow :

## 1. Read papers

Read papers provided by the prof to find useful insights

## 2. Dataset analysis

Find a suitable dataset for our analysis. Understand the meaning of the weights

773 diseases

247k rows
## 3. Data cleaning

Remove outliers and fix invalid values.

## 4. Network analysis

Choosing most suitable type of graph (e.g. bipartite) and compute metrics.

## 5. Feature definition

Define which features will be used to make predictions.
Network features

## 6. Model creation

Train different model with different parameters to find the best one

## 7. Comparison between models

Compare model with network features and the model without them.

# Notes :

1. use a hypotheses testing approach : we decide different network metrics and then we test their significance.
