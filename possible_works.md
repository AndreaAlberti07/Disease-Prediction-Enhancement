## 2. Identifying and understanding the dynamics of financial bubbles

**Description:**

Financial bubbles are periods of rapid and unsustainable growth in asset prices.
Financial bubbles are often characterized by herding behavior, where investors make investment decisions based on the actions of others rather than on their own analysis. 
One way to use network analysis to identify financial bubbles is to look for sudden increases in the number of connections in the network. This may indicate that investors are becoming more interconnected, and that herding behavior is becoming more likely. Additionally, network analysis can be used to identify the most central nodes in the network. These nodes are more likely to influence others, and so they may play a key role in the formation and evolution of financial bubbles.
Another way to use network analysis to understand financial bubbles is to study the dynamics of information diffusion through the network. When new information about an asset becomes available, it can spread through the network and influence the investment decisions of other investors. 

**Steps:**

- Use network analysis to identify the parameters related to financial bubbles.
- Develop network-based models to simulate the formation and evolution of financial bubbles.
- Analyze the network dynamics of financial bubbles to identify patterns and trends that can be used to predict future bubbles.

## 3. Developing network-based models to simulate the spread of financial contagion

Financial contagion is the process by which financial shocks spread from one institution or market to another. It can be triggered by a variety of factors, such as a bank failure, a sovereign debt crisis, or a market crash.
Network analysis can be used to develop network-based models to simulate the spread of financial contagion.
To simulate the spread of financial contagion, network-based models typically use a Monte Carlo approach. This involves randomly selecting a node in the network and assuming that it experiences a shock. The model then uses the network topology to simulate how the shock spreads to other nodes in the network. The model can be used to assess the probability of different contagion scenarios, and to identify the institutions and markets that are most vulnerable to contagion.

**Steps:**

- Construct a network of financial institutions and other relevant entities, such as central banks and governments.
- Use network metrics to identify the most critical nodes and linkages in the network.
- Develop a network-based model to simulate the spread of financial contagion through the network.
- Use the model to assess the impact of different policies and interventions (modifying the network) on the spread of financial contagion.
