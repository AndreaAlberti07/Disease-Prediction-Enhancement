% ------------------- START OF SECTIONS -------------------


% ------------------- Introduction -------------------

% Introduction to the medical problem and how it is currently addressed (some bibliography)
\input{./sections/introduction.tex}
\pagestyle{OtherPage}

% ------------------- Dataset -------------------

% Description of the dataset and its features (some plots and one hot encoding)
\input{./sections/dataset.tex}


% ------------------- Goals -------------------

% Description of the goals of the project:
\input{./sections/goals.tex}
% - ML model to predict the disease
% - Network analysis to find the most important symptoms to reduce complexity, and enhance the available features


% ------------------- Methodology and Results Network -------------------

% Methodology used (very technical)
\input{./sections/methodology_network.tex}
% - network creation (adjacency matrix - not weighted - bipartite)
% - hidalgo + significance
% - communities with co-occurrence matrix
% - betweenness centrality

\input{./sections/results_network.tex}
% - degree distribution and power law
% - most important symptoms/diseases (4 classes) 
% - communities
% - L2 has no sense, it's right that z-score low value
% - Meaning of Z-score
% - betweenness centrality
% - clustering coefficient

% ------------------- Methodology and Results ML -------------------

% How we built the ML model 
\input{./sections/methodology_ML.tex}
% - Face the unbalanced dataset problem
% - select best parameters for symptoms one hot only
% - select best parameters for combination of other features (best combination is chosen with random parameters looking at the accuracy)
% - Face the problem of normalization
% - train for each model the two version above with optimal parameters
% - pick the best model according to accuracy

% Results of the ML model (plots and tables)
\input{./sections/results_ML.tex}
% - selected model performances (see which is the worst error or the most commonly misclassified diseases)
% - Compute accuracy and PR AUC
% - Compute the accuracy of the model dividing the data into the 4 classes (HighL1 - HighL2, LowL1 - HighL2, ...)
% - only with one hot symptoms (with optimal parameters both for one hot and other features) 
% - with new features 
% - reduction in computational complexity

% ---------------------- Conclusion -----------------------------

\input{./sections/conclusion.tex}
\input{./sections/future_works.tex}
% - our approach in feature selection and parameters search is not optimal 
% - list the possible issues (e.g. we are training model on diverse features with the optimal parameters for other features)
% - exploit the knowledge of symptoms communities and their most pointed diseases, using it at prior probability for the model classification
