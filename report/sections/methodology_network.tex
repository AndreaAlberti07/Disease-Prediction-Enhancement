\subsection{Clustering}
To compute the average network clustering coefficient, according to \cite[Watts and Strogatz]{Watts_Strogatz_1998}, it is possible to use the following
formula: 
\begin{equation}
    C = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} C_i = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{2e_i}{k_i(k_i-1)}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of nodes, $C_i$ is the clustering coefficient of node $i$, $e_i$ is the number of edges between the neighbors of node $i$ and $k_i$ is the degree of node $i$.
Specifically, we used the version of clustering coefficient for bipartite graphs, redefined by \cite[Latapy et al.]{Latapy_Magnien_Vecchio_2008} and implemented
in the NetworkX function \texttt{nx.bipartite.average\_clustering}.
