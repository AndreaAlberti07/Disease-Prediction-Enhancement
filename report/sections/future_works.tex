\section{Future Works}
% - our approach in feature selection and parameters search is not optimal 
% - list the possible issues (e.g. we are training model on diverse features with the optimal parameters for other features)
% - exploit the knowledge of symptoms communities and their most pointed diseases, using it at prior probability for the model classification
