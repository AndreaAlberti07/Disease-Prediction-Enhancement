\subsection{Betweenness Centrality}
% BEGIN: betweenness centrality
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:bet_entire}, the betweenness centrality of the nodes in the network follows a Power Law Distribution. This suggests
a scale-free structure of the network, with a few central nodes working as connecting actors, while the majority of the nodes have a low betweenness centrality.
Dividing the centrality values into the two classes of symptoms and diseases (Figures \ref{fig:bet_diseases} and \ref{fig:bet_symptoms}), we can see that 
the symptoms have a higher betweenness centrality than the diseases. To understand the meaning of this result we have to delve into
the interpretation of the betweenness centrality. In general, a symptom is more likely to have a high betweenness centrality if it is
connected to many diseases and these latter are connected to few symptoms. Conversely a disease is more likely to have a high betweenness centrality
if it is connected to many symptoms and these latter are connected to few diseases. Looking at the results of L1 and L2, we can see that in our case
the justification of the higher symptoms betweenness centrality is due to the fact that the symptoms are connected to many diseases, while the diseases
are connected to few symptoms.
From a predictive point of view, this is not a good result, since each symptom is not very specific contributing to many different classes.

Figure \ref{fig:bet_top} shows the top 10 nodes with the highest betweenness centrality. As expected, they are all symptoms and seems 
reasonable that they are the most generic symptoms.
