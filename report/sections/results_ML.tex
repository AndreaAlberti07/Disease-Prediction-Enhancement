\section{ML Model Results}
\label{sec:results_ML}
In this section we present the results of the ML models we have trained. We then deeply inspect the best performing model, 
in order to understand its features and its performance.


% --------------- Model Selection ---------------

\subsection{Model Selection}
\label{subsec:results_ML_model_selection}
% - Matrix plot of stepwise (which is results of algorithm 1) for each model
% - Comparison of the three models (with best combination of features) and best parameters
% - Some other plot that can be informative about how the various models perform



% --------------- New Features Effect ---------------

\subsection{New Features Effect}
% - compare the symptoms one hot model with the one with the new features



% --------------- Best Model Performance ---------------

\subsection{Best Model Analysis}
% - what are its features
% - precision, recall, AUC, accuracy
% - confusion matrix computed on the 4 class diseases (HighL1 - HighL2, LowL1 - HighL2, ...)
% - Worst error
% - Most impactful symptoms



\subsection{Computational Complexity}
% - apply the reduction technique based on symptoms importance (L1 and L2 combined in the 4 classes)
% - compare the performance of the reduced model with the original one
% - compare the times needed to train the two models
