\section{ML Model Results}
\label{sec:results_ML}
% - selected model performances (see which is the worst error or the most commonly misclassified diseases)
% - Compute accuracy and PR AUC
% - Compute the accuracy of the model dividing the data into the 4 classes (HighL1 - HighL2, LowL1 - HighL2, ...)
% - only with one hot symptoms (with optimal parameters both for one hot and other features) 
% - with new features 
% - reduction in computational complexity
