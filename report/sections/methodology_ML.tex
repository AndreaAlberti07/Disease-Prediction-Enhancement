\section{ML Model Methodology}
In this section we describe the techniques used to deal with the ML building, together with the logical flow of the process.

\subsection{Data Balancing}
% - Face the unbalanced dataset problem

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
% - Prepare the features and normalization

\subsection{Operative Flow}
% - Operative Flow
	% - select best parameters for symptoms one hot only
	% - select best parameters for combination of other features (best combination is chosen with random parameters looking at the accuracy)
	% - train for each model the two version above with optimal parameters
	% - pick the best model according to accuracy
	% - train the best model with whole dataset and reduce the number of features
