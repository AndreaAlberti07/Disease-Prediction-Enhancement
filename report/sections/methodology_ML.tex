\section{ML Model Methodology}
% - Face the unbalanced dataset problem
% - select best parameters for symptoms one hot only
% - select best parameters for combination of other features (best combination is chosen with random parameters looking at the accuracy)
% - Face the problem of normalization
% - train for each model the two version above with optimal parameters
% - pick the best model according to accuracy
